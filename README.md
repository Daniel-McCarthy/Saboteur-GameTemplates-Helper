# Saboteur-GameTemplates-Helper
Assists in parsing and learning about the data contained in The Saboteur's GameTemplates.wsd files. These files contain the values
that are used to define each object in the game, set which model to use, and assign their attributes.

This program can list the templates, the data of the templates, and additional information about them to help understand their purpose
and function.
